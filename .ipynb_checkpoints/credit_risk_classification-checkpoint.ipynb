    "\n",
    "- Recall is 0.99, meaning that the model correctly identified 99% of all actual healthy loans. This implies a small number of healthy loans were incorrectly classified as high-risk.\n",

    "- F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is also 1.00, indicating a very strong performance for the healthy loan class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class `1` Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision is 0.85, meaning that when the model predicted a loan to be high-risk, it was correct 85% of the time. This suggests some loans were incorrectly classified as high-risk when they were actually healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall is 0.91, meaning that the model correctly identified 91% of all actual high-risk loans. This implies it missed a small proportion of high-risk loans, classifying them as healthy instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The F1-score is 0.88, suggesting a good performance in the high-risk loan class, although not as strong as for the healthy loan class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- The accuracy of the model overall is 0.99, meaning that it correctly classified 99% of the loans. However, the class imbalance (much more healthy loans than high-risk loans) makes accuracy a less informative metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The macro average (which gives equal weight to each class) for the F1-score is 0.94, suggesting a strong overall performance. The weighted average (which accounts for the imbalance in class distribution) is 0.99, which also indicates a strong overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model predicts the healthy loan class very well and the high-risk loan class reasonably well. However, there is some room for improvement in its prediction of high-risk loans, as indicated by the lower precision and recall scores for this class."

    "#### Class `0` Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision is 1.00, which means that every time the model predicted a loan to be healthy, it was correct. No healthy loans were incorrectly classified as high-risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall is 0.99, meaning that the model correctly identified 99% of all actual healthy loans. A very small number of healthy loans were incorrectly classified as high-risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 1.00, indicating a very strong performance for the healthy loan class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class `1` Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision is 0.84, meaning that when the model predicted a loan to be high-risk, it was correct 84% of the time. This suggests that some loans were incorrectly classified as high-risk when they were actually healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recall, however, is 0.99, meaning that the model correctly identified 99% of all actual high-risk loans. **This is a significant improvement compared to the model trained on imbalanced data, indicating that the oversampling has helped the model catch almost all high-risk loans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The F1-score is 0.91, showing a good performance in the high-risk loan class. **This is higher than the previous model without oversampling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- The accuracy of the model overall is 0.99, meaning that it correctly classified 99% of the loans. But as mentioned before, given the class imbalance, accuracy can be a less informative metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The macro average (which gives equal weight to each class) for the F1-score is 0.95, suggesting a strong overall performance. The weighted average (which accounts for the imbalance in class distribution) is 0.99, which also indicates a strong overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model trained with oversampled data predicts both the healthy loan and high-risk loan classes well. It has significantly improved in predicting high-risk loans, due to the increased representation of this class in the training data thanks to oversampling. However, there was a small decrease in precision for high-risk loans, meaning it incorrectly classified a few healthy loans as high-risk."
